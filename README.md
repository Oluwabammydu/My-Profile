# Week 1 Progress at StartNG(HNG Pre-Internship)
The second task for the first week involved working with HTML. We are to create a simple web page with just HTML, in the web page is our CV. While working on the web page, I was able to work with some HTML tags and elements. I added little creativity to the page also with the use of field set and horizontal line elements.

I also ensured that I made use of HTML5 and best practices like correct indentation, closing the tags myself without depending on the text editor.
